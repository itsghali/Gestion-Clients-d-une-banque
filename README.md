Here is a complete and clean `README.md` file for your **Client and Account Management System in C**:

# 🏦 Client and Account Management System

## 📋 Overview

This is a **C-based banking application** that allows for the management of **clients, accounts, and banking operations** such as **withdrawals** and **transfers**. The system features a menu-driven interface and uses arrays to store client and account data with a focus on clarity, structured code, and basic user interaction through the terminal.

---

## ✨ Features

### 👤 Client Management
- **Add Client**: Register a new client with personal and professional details.
- **Edit Client**: Modify existing client information.
- **Delete Client**: Remove a client from the system.
- **Search Client**:
  - By ID
  - By name

### 💳 Account Management
- **Open Account**: Create a new account and assign it to a client.
- **View Account**: Display details of a specific account.
- **Close Account**: Remove an account from the system.

### 💰 Banking Operations
- **Withdraw**: Perform withdrawals from an account, with balance check.
- **Transfer**: Transfer money between two accounts, validating funds availability.

## 🧱 Data Structures

### `struct Client`
```c
struct Client {
    int id_client;
    char nom[50];
    char prenom[50];
    char profession[50];
    char num_tel[20];
};
```

### `struct Compte`
```c
struct Compte {
    int id_compte;
    int id_client;
    float solde;
    char date_ouverture[20];
};
```

---

## 🗂 Menus & Navigation

### Main Menu
- A. Client Management
- B. Account Management
- C. Operations (Withdraw / Transfer)
- D. Exit

### Submenus
Each main option leads to a submenu with specific features (add, edit, view, delete).

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Clients and accounts are stored in static arrays (`clients[MAX_CLIENTS]`, `comptes[MAX_COMPTES]`).
- Interactions are handled via `scanf()` and `fgets()` for string inputs.
- No external storage is used — data is held in memory during runtime only.
- Validation checks ensure:
  - Max clients/accounts not exceeded
  - Balance is sufficient before transactions
  - IDs are matched during searches

---

## 🧪 Example Usage

```bash
gcc -o bank_app main.c
./bank_app
```

```text
MENU PRINCIPAL
A. Gestion des clients
B. Gestion des comptes
C. Gestion des opérations
D. Quitter
```

---

## 🧭 Limitations

- ❌ No persistent storage (no file or database I/O).
- ❌ No password or authentication system.
- ❌ Limited input validation (no protection from invalid types/overflow).
- ⚠ Static array sizes may restrict scalability.

---

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

- 🗃 Implement file I/O for saving/loading data.
- 🔐 Add user authentication and admin roles.
- 🧠 Use linked lists or dynamic memory for better scalability.
- 🌐 Build a GUI or web interface for enhanced usability.
